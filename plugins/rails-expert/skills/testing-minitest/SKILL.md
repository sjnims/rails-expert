# Testing with Minitest: Rails Testing Philosophy

## Overview

Rails includes a comprehensive testing framework based on Minitest. Testing is baked into Rails from the start—every generated model, controller, and mailer includes a test file.

**Rails testing philosophy:**
- Write tests early and often
- Test-driven development (TDD) is encouraged
- Tests are documentation
- Fast test suite enables confidence
- Test coverage prevents regressions

Rails provides several test types:
- **Model tests**: Business logic and validations
- **Controller tests**: Request handling
- **Integration tests**: Multi-controller workflows
- **System tests**: Full browser simulation
- **Mailer tests**: Email content and delivery
- **Job tests**: Background job behavior

## Minitest vs RSpec

Rails uses **Minitest** by default. It's simple, fast, and built into Ruby.

**Minitest:**
```ruby
test "product must have a name" do
  product = Product.new(price: 9.99)
  assert_not product.valid?
  assert_includes product.errors[:name], "can't be blank"
end
```

**RSpec (alternative):**
```ruby
it "must have a name" do
  product = Product.new(price: 9.99)
  expect(product).not_to be_valid
  expect(product.errors[:name]).to include("can't be blank")
end
```

Rails philosophy: Use Minitest unless you have strong RSpec preference. Minitest is simpler, faster, and requires no extra gems.

## Test Structure

### Test File Organization

```
test/
├── models/              # Model tests
├── controllers/         # Controller tests
├── integration/         # Integration tests
├── system/              # System tests (browser)
├── mailers/             # Mailer tests
├── jobs/                # Job tests
├── helpers/             # Helper tests
├── fixtures/            # Test data
└── test_helper.rb       # Test configuration
```

### Basic Test Structure

```ruby
require "test_helper"

class ProductTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  test "should not save product without name" do
    product = Product.new
    assert_not product.save, "Saved product without name"
  end

  test "should save valid product" do
    product = Product.new(name: "Widget", price: 9.99)
    assert product.save, "Failed to save valid product"
  end
end
```

## Fixtures

Test data defined in YAML files.

### Defining Fixtures

```yaml
# test/fixtures/products.yml
widget:
  name: Widget
  price: 9.99
  available: true
  category: electronics

gadget:
  name: Gadget
  price: 14.99
  available: false
  category: electronics
```

### Using Fixtures

```ruby
test "finds widget by name" do
  widget = products(:widget)  # Loads from fixtures
  assert_equal "Widget", widget.name
  assert_equal 9.99, widget.price
end

test "associates with category" do
  widget = products(:widget)
  assert_equal categories(:electronics), widget.category
end
```

### ERB in Fixtures

```yaml
# test/fixtures/products.yml
<% 10.times do |n| %>
product_<%= n %>:
  name: <%= "Product #{n}" %>
  price: <%= (n + 1) * 10 %>
<% end %>
```

### Associations in Fixtures

```yaml
# test/fixtures/categories.yml
electronics:
  name: Electronics

# test/fixtures/products.yml
widget:
  name: Widget
  category: electronics  # References category fixture
```

## Model Tests

Test business logic, validations, associations, and instance methods.

### Validation Tests

```ruby
require "test_helper"

class ProductTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  test "requires name" do
    product = Product.new(price: 9.99)
    assert_not product.valid?
    assert_includes product.errors[:name], "can't be blank"
  end

  test "requires positive price" do
    product = Product.new(name: "Widget", price: -1)
    assert_not product.valid?
    assert_includes product.errors[:price], "must be greater than 0"
  end

  test "requires unique SKU" do
    existing = products(:widget)
    product = Product.new(name: "New", sku: existing.sku)
    assert_not product.valid?
    assert_includes product.errors[:sku], "has already been taken"
  end
end
```

### Association Tests

```ruby
test "belongs to category" do
  product = products(:widget)
  assert_instance_of Category, product.category
end

test "has many reviews" do
  product = products(:widget)
  assert_respond_to product, :reviews
  assert_kind_of ActiveRecord::Associations::CollectionProxy, product.reviews
end
```

### Method Tests

```ruby
test "calculates discount price" do
  product = products(:widget)
  product.discount_percentage = 10
  assert_equal 8.99, product.discounted_price.round(2)
end

test "checks if in stock" do
  product = products(:widget)
  product.quantity = 5
  assert product.in_stock?

  product.quantity = 0
  assert_not product.in_stock?
end
```

## Controller Tests

Test request handling, rendering, and redirects.

```ruby
require "test_helper"

class ProductsControllerTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
  test "should get index" do
    get products_url
    assert_response :success
    assert_dom "h1", "Products"
  end

  test "should show product" do
    get product_url(products(:widget))
    assert_response :success
    assert_dom "h2", "Widget"
  end

  test "should create product" do
    assert_difference("Product.count", 1) do
      post products_url, params: { product: { name: "New Widget", price: 9.99 } }
    end

    assert_redirected_to product_path(Product.last)
    follow_redirect!
    assert_response :success
  end

  test "should not create invalid product" do
    assert_no_difference("Product.count") do
      post products_url, params: { product: { price: 9.99 } }  # Missing name
    end

    assert_response :unprocessable_entity
  end

  test "should update product" do
    product = products(:widget)
    patch product_url(product), params: { product: { name: "Updated" } }

    assert_redirected_to product_path(product)
    assert_equal "Updated", product.reload.name
  end

  test "should destroy product" do
    product = products(:widget)

    assert_difference("Product.count", -1) do
      delete product_url(product)
    end

    assert_redirected_to products_path
  end
end
```

## System Tests

Full browser simulation using Capybara.

```ruby
require "application_system_test_case"

class ProductsTest < ApplicationSystemTestCase
  test "creating a product" do
    visit products_path
    click_on "New Product"

    fill_in "Name", with: "Widget"
    fill_in "Price", with: "9.99"
    select "Electronics", from: "Category"

    click_on "Create Product"

    assert_text "Product created successfully"
    assert_text "Widget"
  end

  test "editing a product" do
    product = products(:widget)
    visit product_path(product)

    click_on "Edit"

    fill_in "Name", with: "Updated Widget"
    click_on "Update Product"

    assert_text "Product updated successfully"
    assert_text "Updated Widget"
  end

  test "searching products" do
    visit products_path

    fill_in "Search", with: "Widget"
    click_on "Search"

    assert_text "Widget"
    assert_no_text "Gadget"
  end
end
```

## Assertions

### Basic Assertions

```ruby
assert true
assert_not false
assert_nil nil
assert_not_nil "value"
assert_empty []
assert_not_empty [1, 2, 3]
assert_equal 5, 2 + 3
assert_not_equal 5, 2 + 2
assert_match /widget/i, "Widget"
assert_no_match /foo/, "bar"
assert_includes [1, 2, 3], 2
assert_instance_of String, "hello"
assert_kind_of Numeric, 42
assert_respond_to product, :name
assert_raises(ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid) { product.save! }
```

### Rails-Specific Assertions

```ruby
assert_difference('Product.count', 1) { Product.create!(name: "Test") }
assert_no_difference('Product.count') { Product.new.save }
assert_changes -> { product.reload.price }, from: 9.99, to: 14.99
assert_no_changes -> { product.reload.price }
assert_response :success
assert_response :redirect
assert_redirected_to product_path(product)
assert_dom "h1", "Products"
assert_dom "div.product", count: 5
```

### SQL Query Assertions

Test database query behavior:

```ruby
# Assert exact query count
assert_queries_count(2) do
  User.find(1)
  User.find(2)
end

# Assert no queries (useful for caching tests)
assert_no_queries { cached_value }

# Match query patterns
assert_queries_match(/SELECT.*users/) { User.first }
assert_no_queries_match(/UPDATE/) { User.first }
```

### Error Reporter Assertions

Test error reporting behavior:

```ruby
assert_error_reported(CustomError) do
  Rails.error.report(CustomError.new("test"))
end

assert_no_error_reported do
  safe_operation
end
```

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Rails encourages TDD: write tests first, then implement.

### TDD Workflow

1. **Red**: Write failing test
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve code while keeping tests green

**Example:**

```ruby
# 1. RED - Write failing test
test "calculates discount price" do
  product = Product.new(price: 100, discount_percentage: 10)
  assert_equal 90, product.discounted_price
end

# Run test - FAILS (method doesn't exist)

# 2. GREEN - Minimal implementation
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  def discounted_price
    price - (price * discount_percentage / 100.0)
  end
end

# Run test - PASSES

# 3. REFACTOR - Improve code
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  def discounted_price
    return price unless discount_percentage.present?
    (price * (1 - discount_percentage / 100.0)).round(2)
  end
end

# Run test - Still PASSES
```

See `references/tdd-workflow.md` for comprehensive TDD guidance.

## Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
rails test

# Specific file
rails test test/models/product_test.rb

# Specific test
rails test test/models/product_test.rb:14

# By pattern
rails test test/models/*_test.rb

# Failed tests only
rails test --fail-fast

# Verbose output
rails test --verbose
```

## Parallel Testing

Rails can run tests in parallel to speed up large test suites:

```ruby
# test/test_helper.rb
class ActiveSupport::TestCase
  parallelize(workers: :number_of_processors)
end
```

Run with custom worker count:

```bash
PARALLEL_WORKERS=4 rails test
```

Use threads instead of processes for lighter parallelization:

```ruby
parallelize(workers: :number_of_processors, with: :threads)
```

See `references/parallel-testing.md` for comprehensive parallel testing guidance including setup/teardown hooks and debugging flaky tests.

## Time Helpers

Test time-sensitive code with `ActiveSupport::Testing::TimeHelpers`:

```ruby
test "subscription expires after one year" do
  user = users(:subscriber)
  user.update!(subscribed_at: Time.current)

  travel_to 1.year.from_now do
    assert user.subscription_expired?
  end
end

test "discount valid during sale period" do
  travel_to Date.new(2024, 12, 25) do
    assert Product.christmas_sale_active?
  end
end
```

Available helpers:

```ruby
travel_to(date_or_time)     # Set current time within block
travel(duration)            # Move time forward by duration
freeze_time                 # Freeze at current time
travel_back                 # Return to real time (automatic after block)
```
